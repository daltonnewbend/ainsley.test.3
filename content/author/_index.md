 ### artist statement

 As a sculptor, Steeves creates pieces that are based on memories and the connections we make with objects. Initially, the starting point for the objects begins on a personal level with memories and text-based associations. Yet, through the repurposing of materials and by inviting audience interaction with[in] the space, the audience is able to create their own narrative or associations with the objects.
