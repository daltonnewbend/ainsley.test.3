In *Copse*, the white of the plaster showcases the removal of nature while the texture acts as a ghostly reminder of its original form.

Through the arrangement and number of the plaster casts, a copse of trees is created as the casts are able to interact with each other in an arrangement that showcases their reliance on self (through stability) and with other casts (through instability).
