The form of *Fractured*  is based upon a mug from a retail store; however, as a mother mold was not used to retain each castâ€™s structure, the results differed from the expectations of mass production via a mold.

In *Fractured*, through interior and exterior manipulation, each cast of the mug changes as pockets of air cause an unevenness in material. These pockets created holes in the walls and fracturing of the handle, which in turn rendered the mug unable to function as a container of liquids.
