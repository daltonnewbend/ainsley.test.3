Flush to the ground, the trunk sections in *Echoes* are malformed as they echo the impact of outside sources. Unlike *Copse*, an immediate relation to a tree is more difficult as the series of three molds progresses. While the texture can still be related to that of tree bark, as the form continues to be flattened and manipulated, it no longer relates to immediate expectations of the trunk.
