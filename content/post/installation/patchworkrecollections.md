*Patchwork Recollections* focuses on the connection between the storytelling of quilts and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qO7Miceuj2A1UM2EDamhnaMs4Q5xL3gC/edit?tab=t.0">the stories told by objects</a>. The project explores the narratives of Georgia and Alabama natives, while examining the cultural history of quilting in the Columbus area and the Chattahoochee River. *Patchwork Recollections* is inspired by the Geeâ€™s Bend Quiltmakers, a community comprised of African American Women.

>>Special thanks to Hannah Israel and Cathy Fussell for their contribution to this project.
