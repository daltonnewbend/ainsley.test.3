*Familiar Loss* focuses on the gap, figurative and literal, that is left behind when a person passes away. This project displays written and audio memories, mementos, and photos as a reminder of the individuals' importance. Memories are one of the essential ways we remember someone; however, memories are inconsistent and fade over time. Presented, in this piece, are my attempts to search for recollections and information on those I have lost.
