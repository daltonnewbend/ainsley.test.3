>>A hemispherical vessel, which is usually bigger than a cup. Concave. A hollowed, curved interior. Parts of a bowl: the foot, the waist, the body, the rim, and the bottom of the bowl.

When learning how to woodturn, bowls are a typical starting point as they allow for an individual how to correctly use the carving tools, such as the bowl scraper and ball gouge. Due to the different sizing and design choices, visibly noted in the waist and body portion of the bowls, a personâ€™s interaction with the surface differs due to the placement of the beads (rounded, raised profiles) and the coves (concave depressions). The bowl blanks, a cylindrical piece of wood set for turning, provide a sense of the interior grain; however, through the shaping, the emergence of knots create a difference in texture. As material is removed, the moisture content decreases, and the changing humidity and temperature levels can lead to checking, or the separation of the wood fibers (e.g. splitting).

However, as wood has the ability to retain and to lose moisture, its surface is often in a state of expansion and contraction, and in this manner, it continues to fluctuate even when not existing as a live surface.
