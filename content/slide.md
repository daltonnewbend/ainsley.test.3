A few weeks ago, I attended a workshop at Arrowmont in Gatlinburg, TN. The workshop was centered on braiding sweetgrass and was taught by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sweetgrasscreationsbylynette.com/">Lynette D. Youson</a>. Following this workshop, I travelled quite a bit and am now attending a self-directed residency, *Mayo St: Outta Site*.
